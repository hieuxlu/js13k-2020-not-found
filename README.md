This year's #js13k competition, I was able to do a first person camera on a minecraft world, using #WebGL2 and Pointer Lock API . Thanks for this, I had a chance to revise my knowledge of 3D dimensions and matrix transformation.

It's a pity I have to give up at this point, because Sep 13th is the deadline of the competition. :D It was fun and I really appreciate the experience. Definitely gonna return next year.

For those who don't know, js13kGames is a yearly competition to make games with less than 13kB using Javascript. You can read more on their website(https://js13kgames.com/). 

My faverite entry this year is MiniPunk (https://js13kgames.com/entries/minipunk). I intend to learn a lot from it to compete again next year.
